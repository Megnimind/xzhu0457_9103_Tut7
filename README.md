# Creative Coding Major Project - IDED9103

## Project Overview
As part of our major project in Creative Coding, our group has chosen an artwork to represent through code. This task involves analyzing the selected artwork's characteristics and employing coding techniques to create a digital interpretation.

### Selected Artwork
![Selected Artwork](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fa23e2b7f-ae0d-46cf-b5ba-65844e61b0a0_640x640.jpeg)

### Artwork Analysis
The chosen artwork is defined by its vibrant colors and complex geometric patterns, including distinct lines and flat partitions. It presents an excellent challenge for coding due to its intricate and repetitive elements.

### Coding Approach
Our approach will focus on breaking down the artwork into manageable sections. Each section will be coded using classes and functions to ensure the code is organized and maintainable. This structured approach will also facilitate animation tasks that each group member will undertake.

### Tools and Techniques
- **Object-Oriented Programming:** To manage the artwork's complex structure.
- **Animation Libraries:** To add dynamic elements to the representation.

### Project Structure
1. **Analysis of the Artwork:** Understanding the key visual elements.
2. **Coding Setup:** Establishing the basic structure using classes.
3. **Detailing:** Adding complexity through more specific functions.
4. **Animation:** Implementing movement to bring the artwork to life.

### Inspiration
For inspiration and references, we explored various digital artworks and coding projects. [Processing](https://processing.org/examples/) and [p5.js](https://p5js.org/examples/) galleries provided great insights into what's possible with creative coding.
