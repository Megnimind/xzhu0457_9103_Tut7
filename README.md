# Creative Coding Major Project - IDED9103

## Project Overview
As part of our major project in Creative Coding, our group has chosen an artwork to represent through code. This task involves analyzing the selected artwork's characteristics and employing coding techniques to create a digital interpretation.

### Selected Artwork
![Selected Artwork](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fa23e2b7f-ae0d-46cf-b5ba-65844e61b0a0_640x640.jpeg)

### Artwork Analysis
The chosen artwork is defined by its vibrant colors and complex geometric patterns, including distinct lines and flat partitions. It presents an excellent challenge for coding due to its intricate and repetitive elements.

### Coding Approach
Our approach will focus on breaking down the artwork into manageable sections. Each section will be coded using classes and functions to ensure the code is organized and maintainable. This structured approach will also facilitate animation tasks that each group member will undertake.

### Tools and Techniques
- **Object-Oriented Programming:** To manage the artwork's complex structure.
- **Animation Libraries:** To add dynamic elements to the representation.

### Project Structure
1. **Analysis of the Artwork:** Understanding the key visual elements.
2. **Coding Setup:** Establishing the basic structure using classes.
3. **Detailing:** Adding complexity through more specific functions.
4. **Animation:** Implementing movement to bring the artwork to life.

### Inspiration
For inspiration and references, we explored various digital artworks and coding projects. [Processing](https://processing.org/examples/) and [p5.js](https://p5js.org/examples/) galleries provided great insights into what's possible with creative coding.

## Week8 Quiz
### Part 1: Imaging Technique Inspiration
Inspiration: Fluid Dynamics Simulation
In many visually stunning movies, such as The King of the Sea and the underwater effects in Avatar, fluid dynamics simulation is used to create realistic fluid dynamics that provide the viewer with an extremely realistic experience.  Often, fluid dynamics simulation is used to create realistic fluid dynamics, providing the viewer with an extremely realistic underwater effect and experience.

How it helps us design: 
This technology can be used to create dynamic and interactive elements in digital artworks, enhancing the flow of the artwork to make it more visually appealing. At the same time, this technology can help us to present a more vivid visual story to the audience through dynamic liquid simulation when displaying artworks. For example, through AE to make Van Gogh's starry sky flow. But this is not part of the code technology but a good example, we can use the code to show it : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-c1w-SWweY

### Part 2: Coding Technique Exploration

Technology: 
Fluid Dynamics Simulation with WebGL and GLSL Shader
Efficient fluid dynamics simulations can be achieved in the browser using WebGL and GLSL (OpenGL Shading Language) together, a technique that mimics the natural motion of real bodies of water and other fluids.

Application Approach:
Using this technique, we can simulate the dynamic behavior of fluids in real time in web pages, increasing the interactivity and visual appeal of the artwork. This simulation can be influenced by user input (e.g., mouse movements) to create a dynamic art environment that responds to user behavior.
